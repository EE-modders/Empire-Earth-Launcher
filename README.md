## üåê Download
Sorry, at the moment the launcher is **ABSOLUTELY NOT** available for download in its current state.\
To use the Launcher you will only need the .NET Framework 2 on your computer.

## Dev
You just need to clone the repo and open the project with Visual Studio (and C# installed in Visual Studio Installer)\
By the way I am aware of the extremely disastrous management of downloads (Async etc...), feel free to rewrite this disaster.
