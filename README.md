# Empire Earth Launcher

### The project is being reworked. I'm still in the draft stage but changes will take place.

The project will **move from .NET 2 to 3.5 or 4**\
Will support Windows XP to 10 (So not using .NET 2 will **drop support for Windows 98 and 2000**)\
Will switch **from WinForm to WPF**\
Will have a **completely reworked interface**\
The **code will be almost completely rewritten**

New features ideas :

Addons Browser and Installer\
A full list of compatiblity settings\
A build-in compatibility tracker or a way to give feedback about config

Note :\
We have to admit that the code currently written is not very good and done in a hurry, this is one of the main causes of this decision.\
The project will of course stay under [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/EE-modders/Empire-Earth-Launcher/blob/main/LICENSE)

## üåê Download
Sorry, at the moment the launcher is **ABSOLUTELY NOT** available for download in its current state.\
To use the Launcher you will only need the .NET Framework 2 on your computer.

## Dev
You just need to clone the repo and open the project with Visual Studio (and C# installed in Visual Studio Installer)\
By the way I am aware of the extremely disastrous management of downloads (Async etc...), feel free to rewrite this disaster.
