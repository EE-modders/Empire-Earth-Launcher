## 🌐 Download
Sorry, at the moment the launcher is **ABSOLUTELY NOT** available for download in its current state.\
To use the Launcher you will only need the .NET Framework >= 4 on your computer.

## Dev
You just need to clone the repo and open the project with Visual Studio **2019** (and C#/.NET 4 installed in Visual Studio Installer)\
Some very critical parts of the Launcher can be censored like WON and NeoEE related important operation but most of the reverse WON C# implementation is availaible 💪
